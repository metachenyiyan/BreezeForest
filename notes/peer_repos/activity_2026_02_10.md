## Detailed Analysis

### zuko (probabilists/zuko)
**Activity**: Low (most recently active)
**Stats**: 442 stars, 34 forks, 4 open issues

#### Key Updates (Recent History)
- `bb2dddd` 2025-12-01 — **feat**: Add passthrough of attributes to base model in BayesianModel
- `9a0700f` 2025-10-16 — **perf**: Optimize autograd.grad calls in eval mode
- `ce32638` 2025-10-16 — **refactor**: Use keyword arguments for unconditional components
- `7f467db` 2025-10-03 — **release**: Bump version to 1.5.0
- `3f09b10` 2025-10-03 — **feat**: Add Bayesian flows

#### Technical Direction
Zuko is the most actively maintained normalizing flow library. Recent focus: Bayesian flow integration (v1.5.0), performance optimization of autograd calls, and API refinements. Moving toward probabilistic/Bayesian applications beyond simple density estimation.

#### Relevance to BreezeForest
- **Autograd optimization** (eval-mode grad calls): Could inform BreezeForest's `train_forward_exact` using `jacrev`
- **Library design patterns**: Zuko's clean API (flow transforms as PyTorch modules) is a model for how BreezeForest could be packaged
- **Bayesian flows**: Novel direction that BreezeForest could explore

### nflows (bayesiains/nflows)
**Activity**: Dormant (last commit Dec 2024 — docs only)
**Stats**: 991 stars, 137 forks, 15 open issues

#### Key Updates (Recent History)
- `5d22344` 2024-12-27 — **docs**: Add conda-forge install instructions
- `3b122e5` 2023-11-19 — **docs**: Adding MIT license badge
- `569c8ad` 2022-12-23 — **feat**: Allow identity initialization for rational quadratic spline transform

#### Technical Direction
Mature, stable library. No active development. Last significant feature was spline transform improvements in late 2022. The project appears feature-complete for its scope.

#### Relevance to BreezeForest
- **Rational quadratic splines**: nflows' spline transform implementation is a reference for alternative monotone transformations (vs BreezeForest's constrained-weight approach)
- **API patterns**: Well-established transform composition patterns

---

### normflows (VincentStimper/normalizing-flows)
**Activity**: Dormant (last commit Aug 2024)
**Stats**: 929 stars, 132 forks, 15 open issues

#### Key Updates (Recent History)
- `c6616b1` 2024-08-25 — **docs**: Clarified input variables of multiscale flow
- `b878a7a` 2024-08-25 — **fix**: Fix multiscale core to not require class conditional
- `848277e` 2024-03-01 — **docs**: Add references to recent papers using normflows

#### Technical Direction
General-purpose normalizing flows library. Recent focus was minor fixes and documentation. Includes implementations of many flow types (planar, radial, coupling, autoregressive, residual).

#### Relevance to BreezeForest
- **Comprehensive benchmark**: normflows includes many flow types under one API — useful for comparative benchmarking
- **Multiscale architecture**: Could inform hierarchical extensions of BreezeForest

---

### FrEIA (vislearn/FrEIA)
**Activity**: Dormant (last commit Jul 2024)
**Stats**: 846 stars, 115 forks, 38 open issues

#### Key Updates (Recent History)
- `4212496` 2024-07-03 — **docs**: Correct link to conditional INN paper
- `802d840` 2024-03-19 — **fix**: Check for 0-dim tensors
- `09b4af0` 2024-01-22 — **docs**: Generate Python docs

#### Technical Direction
Framework for invertible architectures, focused on coupling-based (INN) approaches. High issue count (38) suggests maintenance challenges. Focused on scientific applications (physics, inverse problems).

#### Relevance to BreezeForest
- **Conditional flows**: FrEIA's conditional INN patterns could inform conditional density extensions of BreezeForest
- **Scientific applications**: FrEIA's use in physics could be a target domain for BreezeForest

---

### FFJORD (rtqichen/ffjord)
**Activity**: Dormant (last commit Sep 2020)
**Stats**: 664 stars, 143 forks, 0 open issues

#### Technical Direction
Reference implementation for the FFJORD paper. No development since 2020. The continuous normalizing flow approach has been absorbed into larger libraries (torchdyn, torchdiffeq).

#### Relevance to BreezeForest
- **Trace estimation**: FFJORD's Hutchinson trace estimator is an alternative to BreezeForest's finite-difference Jacobian
- **Benchmark comparison target**: Well-known baseline for density estimation

### Other Repositories
- **nsf** (284 stars): Neural Spline Flows reference implementation. Last real commit 2020; recent update (Oct 2025) was README only. Archived in favor of nflows.
- **residual-flows** (273 stars): Reference implementation. Dormant since 2023.
- **survae_flows** (290 stars): Surjective flows. Dormant since 2021.
- **BNAF** (181 stars): Reference implementation. Dormant since 2021.
- **flowtorch**: Facebook Research project. Returns 404 — likely deleted/archived.

## Cross-Project Trends

1. **Ecosystem stagnation**: All tracked repositories are dormant or low-activity. The normalizing flow library ecosystem peaked in 2020-2022 and has consolidated. Active development has moved to larger frameworks (PyTorch, JAX-based libraries) or application-specific codebases.

2. **Consolidation into general ML libraries**: Flow implementations are increasingly found in Pyro, numpyro, and PyTorch distributions rather than standalone repos. Zuko is the exception, maintaining a focused flow library.

3. **Shift to transformer-based flows**: Recent research (TarFlow, FARMER) uses transformer architectures but code is typically in private/per-paper repos rather than open libraries.

4. **Reference implementations vs libraries**: Most repos (BNAF, FFJORD, nsf, residual-flows) are paper reference implementations, not maintained libraries. Only nflows, normflows, zuko, and FrEIA attempted to be reusable libraries.

## Signals Worth Noting

### Notable
- **flowtorch deletion**: Facebook Research's flowtorch returning 404 signals corporate retreat from the normalizing flows space
- **Zuko's Bayesian flows**: The most active repo is exploring Bayesian extensions, suggesting this is the growth direction
- **High star counts with dormancy**: nflows (991 stars) and normflows (929 stars) show strong historical interest but no current maintenance — potential opportunity for a well-maintained alternative

### Opportunities
- **Gap in the ecosystem**: No actively maintained library focuses on autoregressive flows with universal approximation. BreezeForest could fill this niche.
- **Benchmarking**: With all peer repos dormant, BreezeForest has the opportunity to publish results on standard benchmarks without a moving target.
- **Zuko integration**: The most active peer (zuko) has a clean API; BreezeForest could potentially contribute a tree-based autoregressive transform to zuko's ecosystem.
- **Modern PyTorch features**: Most peer repos use older PyTorch patterns. BreezeForest already uses `torch.func.jacrev` and `vmap` — more modern than any peer.
